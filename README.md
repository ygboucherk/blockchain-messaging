# blockchain-messaging
This project is made for sending messages (text) using blockchain ! It's only for testing, so :D

Smart contract is coded using solidity, and is able to run on any evm-based chain !

It uses nonces for finding a message (yeah), and also usernames (it links crypto addresses and usernames)
